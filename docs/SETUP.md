# Personal Assistant Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with you- Restart both the development server and Expo Go app

**Native module linking errors**
- If you see errors about native modules not being linked
- This typically occurs when using libraries not compatible with Expo Go
- Solution: We use only Expo-compatible libraries in this project
- Run: `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache and restart

### Getting Help
- Check [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- Visit [Google AI Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/)

4. Copy your new API key

### 2. Configure the App
1. Open `config.js` in your project
2. Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   API_KEY: 'your_actual_api_key_here',
   ```

### 3. Run the App
```bash

  MODEL_NAME: 'gemini-1.5-flash', // Available: gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro
  MAX_TOKENS: 150,                 // Increase for longer responses (costs more)
  TEMPERATURE: 0.7,                // 0.0 = focused, 1.0 = creative
}
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Please configure your Gemini API key"**
- Make sure you've added your API key to `config.js`
- Check that the API key is valid and active

**App won't start**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed

**Build errors**
- Clear cache: `npx expo start --clear`
- Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**Can't connect phone to app**
- Ensure phone and computer are on same Wi-Fi network
- Try restarting `npm start` and scanning QR code again
- Check if your firewall is blocking the connection
- Make sure Expo Go app is updated to latest version

**QR code won't scan**
- Try scanning with Expo Go app instead of camera
- Increase brightness on computer screen
- Make sure QR code is fully visible in terminal

**App loads but crashes**
- Check terminal for error messages
- Try clearing Expo cache: `npx expo start --clear`
- Restart both the development server and Expo Go app

**Reanimated version mismatch error**
- If you see "[Reanimated] Mismatch between Javascript part and native part"
- Run: `npm install react-native-reanimated@3.17.4`
- Clear cache: `npx expo start --clear`
- Restart the development server

**react-native-keyboard-controller error**
- If you see "react-native-keyboard-controller doesn't seem to be linked"
- This occurs with packages that require native linking but aren't compatible with Expo Go
- Solution: We've replaced react-native-gifted-chat with a custom Expo-compatible chat component
- Run: `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache and restart

### Getting Help
- Check [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- Visit [Google AI Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/docs)
- Review [React Native Gifted Chat docs](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat)

## üì¶ Building for Production

### Installing Java Development Kit (JDK) for Keytool

**Why you need JDK:**
- EAS Build requires `keytool` to generate Android keystores
- Without it, you'll get "500 Internal Server Error" from Expo's cloud service

**Installation Options:**

### Option 1: Download from Oracle (Recommended for Windows)
1. Visit [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
2. Download "Windows x64 Installer" for JDK 11 or newer
3. Run the installer as Administrator
4. Follow the installation wizard
5. Restart your terminal/PowerShell

### Option 2: Download Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK)
1. Visit [Adoptium Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
2. Select "Windows" and "x64" for your platform
3. Download the ".msi" installer for JDK 11+
4. Run the installer as Administrator
5. Make sure to check "Set JAVA_HOME environment variable"
6. Restart your terminal/PowerShell

### Option 3: Using Chocolatey (Recommended - Run PowerShell as Administrator)
```bash
# Open PowerShell as Administrator, then run:
choco install openjdk11 -y

# After installation, refresh environment variables:
$env:PATH = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","User")
```

### Option 4: Using winget (Windows Package Manager)
```bash
# In PowerShell or Command Prompt:
winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.11.JDK
```

### Verify Installation
After installing, restart your terminal and check:
```bash
java -version
keytool -help
```

You should see version information for both commands.

### Android APK Build Process

**Method 1: EAS Build (With Local Keytool)**
```bash
# Now that you have keytool installed:
eas build --platform android
```

**Method 2: Expo Build Classic (Alternative)**
```bash
npx expo build:android
```

### iOS IPA (requires Apple Developer account)
```bash
npx expo build:ios
```

### Using EAS Build for Both Platforms
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure your project
eas configure

# Build for all platforms
eas build --platform all
```

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

**500 Internal Server Error when generating keystore**
- Install JDK locally (see instructions above)
- Restart your terminal after JDK installation
- Try the build command again

**"keytool not found" error**
- Make sure JDK is properly installed
- Restart your terminal/PowerShell
- Check that `keytool -help` works
- If still not working, add Java bin directory to your PATH

**Build takes too long or fails**
- Check [Expo Status Page](https://status.expo.dev/) for service issues
- Try building during off-peak hours
- Use `eas build --platform android --clear-cache` to clear cache

**Alternative: Local APK Generation**
If cloud builds continue to fail:
```bash
# Generate development build
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android

# This creates a debug APK in:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```


## üì¶ After Building Successfully

### Understanding Your Build Output

**Android App Bundle (.aab)**
- Modern format for Google Play Store distribution
- Optimized for different device configurations
- Cannot be installed directly on devices

**APK (Android Package)**
- Traditional format for direct installation
- Can be installed on any Android device
- Good for testing and private distribution

### What to Do Next

**For Testing/Private Use:**
```bash
# Get APK version for direct installation
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Or use the classic build for APK
npx expo build:android
```

**For Google Play Store:**
1. Create [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/) account ($25)
2. Upload your .aab file
3. Complete app listing (description, screenshots, etc.)
4. Submit for review

**For Direct Installation:**
```bash
# Download APK from build URL
# Enable "Unknown Sources" on Android device
# Install APK directly
```

### Converting .aab to .apk (Working Method)
If you need to convert your .aab to installable .apk:

```bash
# Download your .aab file from Expo build URL
curl -L -o oscar.aab https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/YOUR_BUILD_URL.aab

# Download official Google bundletool
curl -L -o bundletool.jar https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases/download/1.15.6/bundletool-all-1.15.6.jar

# Convert .aab to universal APK
java -jar bundletool.jar build-apks --bundle=oscar.aab --output=oscar_v1.apks --mode=universal

# Extract the APK file
copy oscar_v1.apks oscar_v1.zip
powershell "Expand-Archive -Path oscar_v1.zip -DestinationPath extracted_apks -Force"
copy "extracted_apks\universal.apk" "Oscar_PersonalAssistant_v1.apk"
```

**Note**: The npm bundletool package doesn't work properly. Use the official Google bundletool JAR file instead.
